Did you know and/or had used HTML and CSS before this assignment?
Yes, I have previous experience with HTML and CSS prior to this assignment. I have used them to create basic web pages and understand the basics of web development.


Briefly explain, with your own words, about HTML to a person who have never heard of it before.
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a standardized markup language used to structure and present content on web pages. It is used to define different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs and links, by using different HTML tags.


Briefly explain, with your own words, about CSS to a person who have never heard of it before.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It provides the opportunity to control the layout, colors and typography of web pages and thus separates the design from the content itself.

Elaborate on the importance of keeping HTML (markup and content) and CSS (style and layout) as two separate items. Is it important and in that case why? Can it be completely separated or do they somehow depend on each other?


It's important to keep HTML and CSS separate because it promotes a clean and modular code structure. HTML handles the structure and content of the web page while CSS is responsible for the presentation and style. This enables code reuse and makes it easier to maintain and update web pages. Although they are separate, they depend on each other to create a complete and well-designed web page.


Is there something you did not do with your website but you would like to do if you had the time and skill? It could pehaps be some improvements.
If I had more time and skills, I would like to implement responsive design to ensure that the website looks good and works smoothly on different devices and screen sizes. It would increase user experience and accessibility.


What is your TIL for this course part?
Today I learned the importance of using semantic HTML to improve accessibility and search engine optimization. By using correct HTML elements for different parts of the web page, I can make the page more meaningful and understandable for both users and search engines.
