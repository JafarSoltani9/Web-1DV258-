# A2 Quiz

I have created a simple HTML interface. The starting page displays some information and rules about the game. Under the 'Information' heading, there is an input box where the user can enter their name. After entering the name, the user can press the 'Start' button to begin the game. The name box must not be left empty; otherwise, a warning will be displayed, indicating that the user must enter a name.

If the user answers all the questions correctly, the remaining time after each question is answered is calculated. The user who answers more quickly will be ranked higher on the to list.

I used "npm run lint" to execute all linters and tried fix all errors.
