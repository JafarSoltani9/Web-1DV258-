# Memory game
In this simple memory game, you match cards and choose from three levels. The game counts your tries and has a reset button when you win. Cards flip and show animations when matched or not. There's a hint button for help. You can play using your mouse or keyboard, moving with arrow keys and flipping cards with enter or space. When you win, a message pops up.

# Chat Application

The chat interface is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, focusing on ease of connection and communication.

It's handy because you can quickly see the weather for any city you're interested in. The Weather page is easy to use and gives you the important weather information fast.
